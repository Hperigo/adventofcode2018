# Advent of Code 2018

In 2015 I stopped at level 5 with very messy code.<br/>
In 2016 I stopped at level 7 but used tests and linters [(2016 repo)](https://github.com/zehfernandes/adventofcode2016). <br/>
In 2017 I stopeed at level 9 with a good code clarity [(2017 repo)](https://github.com/zehfernandes/adventofcode2017).

This year my goal is mixing data visualization.

Wish me luck ðŸ˜ƒ
